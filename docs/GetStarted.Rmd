## R Basics

This document has "code chunks" that should help get started with using R to analyze and visualize the fish diet data that Brian provided.

### Try something simple

R can do basic calculations right from the "Console" when you type them in at the `>` prompt.

Try typing in `2+2` at the `>` prompt and see what happens. 

### Reading data into R

The diet dataset is called `allwt2.csv` and I have downloaded it from the google drive and put it in a folder called `data`. It is easy to read data in to R, but the hard part is usually having R know where to look for the data. I can tell R where to look for it on my computer in order to read it in, or I can read it directly from the google drive. 

In the first line below, I tell R to use the package called `here` which establishes the place on my computer where I am running my session as the place to look. The second line below reads the file using the R command `read.csv` on the file `allwt2.csv` that is located in the `data` folder.

```{r}
library(here)

dietdat1 <- read.csv(here("data/allwt2.csv"))

```

If we type `dietdat1` at the prompt, we see the some or all of the datafile, depending on how long it is.

```{r, attr.output = 'style="max-height: 100px;"'}

dietdat1

```

Quick ways to view the data are the R functions `head`, which gives the top 6 lines of the dataset including the column names, and `names`, which just tells you the column (variable) names.

```{r}
head(dietdat1)

names(dietdat1)
```

## Basic data visualization

There are many possible ways to look at the data that R can facilitate. Here I'll use `tidyverse` functions because I am used to them, but there are a lot of ways to do this using base R or other packages.

First we'll look at how many tows per year there are for each predator in each area (Ecological Production Unit--epu in the dataset).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# make a new dataset called ntows from dietdat1 that sums tows into a variable called anntows

ntows <- dietdat1 %>% # a pipe operator that strings the commands together
  group_by(comname, year, epu) %>% # for each predator/year/epu combo
  summarise(anntows = sum(num_tows, na.rm = TRUE)) # sum the tows

ntows
  
```

Now we can plot our new ntows dataset to see how many tows had stomach collections (sample size) for each species in each area over time.

```{r}

# ggplot is a quick way to look across lots of things
# the aes statement sets up x and y axis variable
# with color differentiating area, 
# line plot is defined with geom_line, and
# using facet_wrap does a plot for each predator (comname)

ntows %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=anntows, color=epu)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~comname)
  

```

There are a lot of predators! So maybe we should just look at a few:

```{r}

# filter allows us to only look at a few species
# otherwise code is the same as above

ntows %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(comname %in% c("SUMMER FLOUNDER",
                        "SILVER HAKE",
                        "LITTLE SKATE",
                        "ATLANTIC COD"
                        )) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=anntows, color=epu)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~comname)

```

Now we have an idea of how many tows were sampled for diet in each area for each species over time.

You can try copying the code from each codeblock to see if this works on your computer.
