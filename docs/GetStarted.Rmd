## R Basics

This document has "code chunks" that should help get started with using R to analyze and visualize the fish diet data that Brian provided.

### Try something simple

R can do basic calculations right from the "Console" when you type them in at the `>` prompt.

Try typing in `2+2` at the `>` prompt and see what happens. 

### Reading data into R

The diet dataset is called `allwt2.csv` and I have downloaded it from the google drive and put it in a folder called `data`. It is easy to read data in to R, but the hard part is usually having R know where to look for the data. I can tell R where to look for it on my computer in order to read it in, or I can read it directly from the google drive. 

In the first line below, I tell R to use the package called `here` which establishes the place on my computer where I am running my session as the place to look. The second line below reads the file using the R command `read.csv` on the file `allwt2.csv` that is located in the `data` folder.

```{r}
library(here)

dietdat1 <- read.csv(here("data/allwt2.csv"))

```

If we type `dietdat1` at the prompt, we see the top of the datafile.

```{r}

dietdat1

```
